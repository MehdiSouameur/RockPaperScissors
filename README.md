# Rock Paper Scissors

Welcome to my Rock, paper, Scissors submission for the True technical assessment!

For this challenge I decided to use **React with Typescript**. I'm aware this is for a .Net C# role, however I code in C# every day and I have been learning React and Typescript recently and thought this was a good opportunity to learn React and Typescript whilst completing the assessment. In C#, I would've either used .Net's WPF (As I've made a few small games on it before) or I would've gone for a command line implementation.

I've hosted the game on Render here: https://mehdi-rockpaperscissors.onrender.com/

I'm aware that what I made is a little over the scope of what was asked, in fact I spent significantly more time working on the Front UI than the core logic itself dealing with html and css problems but it was a great learning experience and I feel much more comfortable using React and Typescript after this little project.

You can find the core game logic under **client/src/components/Game.tsx** inside the function **onEvaluate()**.
